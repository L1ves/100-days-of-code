**Today's Progress**: I continued learn functions. Now a learn Python Function within Functions
 

### Day 8: September 21, Tue

**Today's Progress**: I continued learn functions. Now a learn Python lambda Functions
 

**Thoughts**  Lambda definition does not include a ‚Äúreturn‚Äù statement, it always contains an expression that is returned. We can also put a lambda definition anywhere a function is expected, and we don‚Äôt have to assign it to a variable at all. This is the simplicity of lambda functions.
